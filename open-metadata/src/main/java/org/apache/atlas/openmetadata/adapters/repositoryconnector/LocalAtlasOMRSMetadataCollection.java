/**
 *  The LocalAtlasOMRSMetadataCollection represents a local metadata repository.
 *  Requests to this metadata collection are mapped to requests to the local repository.
 *
 *  The metadata collection reads typedefs from Atlas and will attempt to convert them to OM typedefs - and
 *  vice versa. During these conversions it will check the validity of the content of the type defs as far as
 *  possible, giving up on a typedef that it cannot verify or convert.
 *
 *  This implementation of the metadata collection does not use the java implementations of the REST APIs because
 *  the REST interface is servlet and http oriented. This implementation uses lower level classes in Atlas.
 *  The behaviour still respects transactions because they are implemented at levels below the REST implementation.
 *  The transactions are implemented by annotation in the underlying implementations of the AtlasTypeDefStore
 *  interface.

             *
             * For entities, relationships and classifications it will parse each TypeDef and will produce a corresponding OM
             * type def - which will be of concrete type (e.g. EntityDef). It can only do this for Atlas defs that can be modelled in
             * OM - some things are not possible, in which case no OM def is produced for that Atlas def.
             * It will validate that the generated OM type is valid - i.e. that all mandatory fields are present, that no constraints are
             * violated, etc - Note that this validation step is not very explicit yet - it will be refined/extended later.
             * The MDC must then check whether the generated OM type is known in the RCM. It uses the RepoHelper and Validator
             * classes for this - it can new up a RepoHelper and this will have a static link to the RCM. It should then issue
             * a get by name of the typedef against the RCM. I think this might use isKnownType().
             * If the type is found within the RCM, then we know that it already exists and we must then perform a deep
             * compare of the known type and the newly generated type. If they are the same then we can safely use the
             * known type; we adopt it's GUID and add the typedef to the TDG. If they do not match exactly then we issue
             * an audit log entry and ignore the generated type (it will not be added to the TDG). If the type is NOT found in the
             * RCM then we are dealing with a newly discovered type and we can generate a GUID (using the usual means). The generated
             * typedef is added to the TDG.
             * In addition to looking in the RCM we need to look at any types we already added to the TDG (in this pass) because each
             * type only appears once in the TDG. This can be a compare by name only and does not need a compare of content (which is needed
             * vs a type found in the RCM by name) because the type namespace in Atlas means that two references by the same name must by
             * definition be references to the same type.
             * The above processing is similar for EntityDef, RelationshipDef and ClassificationDef typedefs. The MDC is either referring to
             * known types or generating newly discovered types for those types not found in the RCM.
             *
             * The above types can (and probably will) contain attribute defs. For each attribute the MDC needs to decide what type
             * the attribute has. It will either be an Enum, a Prim or a Coll of Prim, or it may be a type reference or coll of type reference.
             * In the last two cases (involving type refs) the enclosing typedef will be skipped (not added to the TypeDefGallery). This is
             * because type references are specific to older Atlas types and in OM the types should use first-class relationships.
             * The older Atlas types are therefore not pulled into OM.
             *
             * Whenever an enclosing typedef (EntityDef, RelationshipDef or ClassificationDef) is added to the TypeDefGallery it will have a
             * propertiesDef which is a list of TDA, each having the attribute name and an AttributeTypeDef which is on the TypeDefGallery's
             * attributeTypeDefs list.
             * This is similar to how one TypDef refers to another TypeDef (as opposed to a property/attribute): when a TypeDef refers to another
             * TypeDef a similar linkage is established through a TypeDefLink that refers to a TypeDef on the TypeDefGallery's typeDefs list.
             * For attribute types that are either consistent and known or valid and new we add them to the TypeDefGallery's list of attributeTypeDefs.
             * Where multiple 'top-level' typedefs contain attributes of the same type - e.g. EntityDef1 has an int called 'retention' and
             * EntityDef2 has an int called 'count' - then they will both refer to the same single entry for the int primitive attr type in the
             * TypeDefGallery. References to types in the TypeDefGallery are by TypeDefLink (which needs a cat, name and guid).
             *
             * So the attribute types to be processed are:
             *
             * Primitive - for each of these the MDC will match the Atlas typename (a string) against the known PrimDefCats and construct a
             * PrimitiveDef with the appropriate PrimDefCat. Look in the RCM and if a Prim with the same string typename exists then adopt its GUID.
             * [There is a shortcut here I think as the RCM will have used the same GUID as the PrimDefCat so you can find the GUID directly.]
             * I think it is very unlikely that there will be new Primitives discovered. In fact I think that is impossible.
             *
             * Collection - a Collection can be either an ARRAY<Primitive> or a MAP<Primitive,Primitive>. In both cases we can create a consistent
             * name for the collection type by using the pattern found in CollectionDef[Cat]. The MDC uses that collection type name to
             * check whether the collection type is already known in the RCM (again this is a get by name, since we do not have a GUID).
             * If the collection is a known type then we will use the GUID from the RCM and add it. It is likely that the RCM
             * will already know about a small number of collections - eg. Map<String,String> - so for these the MDC will reuse the
             * existing attributeDef - it will still add the collection def and will refer to it using a TDL with the cat, name and guid.
             * Any further coll defs will be generated and given a new GUID.
             *
             * Enum - An Enum Def is easier to convert than a Primitive or a Collection because in Atlas it is a real type and has a guid. Processing for
             * an enum will be more like that for EntityDef, etc. and will require validation (of possible values, default value, etc) and an existence
             * check in the RCM. If known we will do a deep compare and on match will use the existing def, on mismatch generate audit log entry and
             * skip not just the enum but also any type that contains it. If it does not exist in the RCM we will generate a new EnumDef with a new GUID.
             *
             * Unit Testing
             * ------------
             * 3 phases of elaboration.
             * 1. Just assume (assert?) that each type does not exist in the RCM and hence we will project it into the generated √. This is a good way
             * to see and verify the generation of types by the MDC. The generator and comparator should be able to generate/compare √.
             * 2. Mock up the RCM so that we can control what it 'already knows'. This will allow us to test the existence match behaviour of MDC and
             * the apparent-match-but-different-content logic and audit log entry generation.
             * 3. Like UT1 (assume that everything is new) but have all the OM types loaded into Atlas. This will allow us to test whether the integration
             * with Atlas is working and whether the types are coming through OK. This is actually an integration test I think.
             *

             *  * The optional InstanceProperties object contains a list of property filters - each property filter specifies
             *    the type, name and value of a property that a matching entity must possess. Only the named properties are
             *    compared; properties that are not named in the InstanceProperties object are ignored. Where a named property
             *    is of type String, the property will match if the specified value is contained in the value of the named
             *    property - i.e. it does not have be an exact match. For all other types of property - i.e. non-String
             *    properties - the value comparison is an exact match.
             *
             *  * The property filters can be combined using the matchCriteria of ALL or ANY, but not NONE. If null, this will default to ALL
             *
             *  * The results can be narrowed by optionally specifying one or more instance status values - the results
             *    will only contain entities that have one of the specified status values
             *
             *  * The results can be narrowed by optionally specifying one or more classifications - the results will
             *    only contain entities that have all of the specified classifications
             *
             *  All of the above filters are optional - if none of them are supplied - i.e. no entityTypeGUID, matchProperties,
             *  status values or classifications - then ALL entities will be returned. This will perform very badly.

             *  --------------
             *  It is difficult to see how to implement the combination of NONE and string searchCriteria - there is no
             *  NOT operator in DSL nor in SearchWithParameters, and the only solution I can currently think of is a
             *  negated regex which seems unduly complex. Short of performing two searches and subtracting one from the
             *  other - which would not perform well - I am currently stuck for a solution. This might require direct manipulation
             *  of the gremlin - which would make for an untidy solution alongside Atlas's other query methods; or we would
             *  need to introduce negation operators into Atlas, which will take longer to implement but is probably the nicest
             *  option. So for now this method is not supporting matchCriteria NONE.

         *
         * To understand why this would be a problem consider the following:
         * Suppose there are 100 entities that would match our search.
         * If we were to specify an offset of 20 and pageSize of 30 we would receive back entities 20 - 49.
         * If any of those entities fails the subsequent instance status or classification filter then we will get
         * a subset of a page of entities - none of the current method, the caller nor the end user can tell whether
         * there are other entities outside the range 20-49 that would have been valid and passed the status filter.
         * To provide a valid and maximal result we must only apply offset and pageSize once the post-filtering
         * is complete.
         *
         * In theory, we could allow Atlas to perform a narrower search where we know we will be filtering by
         * instanceStatus by testing (limitResultsByStatus != null). However, there is also filtering out of
         * entity proxies and since we do not know which entities are proxies until after the search is complete,
         * we must always search as widely as Atlas will allow.
